                <p>Since August of 2019 I have been working on a website for CMU's LGBTQ+ organization, PRISM. A bit of advice for those out there planning on doing the same: <em>don't</em> do that without at least <em>some</em> prior experience. Having to learn decent HTML, CSS, JS, Apache, and Django (python) is too much to handle at once. Despite this, I am rather happy with the progress I am making. Has this taken me more than a year? Yes. Am I upset it took so long to understand how to integrate all of these tools together into one website? Also yes. A fun and engaging challenge nonetheless.</p>
